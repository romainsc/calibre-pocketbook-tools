<h1>Calibre PocketBook Tools help</h1>
<p>Basic plugin offering several tools for (recent) Pocketbook readers.</p>
<p>When Calibre recognises an USB connected PocketBook reader, the menu options should become available.<br />
    It should support most recent HD, Lux, Basic and Inkpad models.</p>

<h2>Requirements</h2>
<p>Plugin was tested with the 'PocketBook Lux 2' driver with Calibre versions 3.48-5.x, under Linux and Windows 10.
Plugin will run under 2.58 but could not be tested due to device driver issues (if wanting, checkout CLI options for main.py).
</p>
<p>*Uses Vendor ID = [0xfffe]</p>

<h2>TODO, support and questions</h2>
<p>Please visit the Mobileread thread: <a href="https://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=339806">https://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=339806</a></p>

<h2>Tools</h2>
<h3>Copy (...) files to device (GUI + CLI)</h3>
<p>Copies user selected .acsm, .app, .dic/.pbi and font (.ttf/.otf) files to the appropiate folder on the connected reader.</p>
<p><em>.zip support requires Calibre 4.99.x or newer. Note that the simplified extraction method may lose (redundant) file metadata and loads files into memory (one at a time).</em></p>

<h3>Backup Database(s)</h3>
<p>Copies explorer-x.db and books.db(s) to the specified directory, with 'profile' name and date appended.</p>
<p>The first contains file metadata from the library interface, and reading positions.
The latter contains annotations and (unused) metadata.</p>
<p><em>Notes: files are compared after copying.</em></p>

<h3>Export Highlights to HTML</h3>
<p><em>Note: Highlights edited using the device's Notes app, may lose their page location information.</em></p>
<p>For additional exporting features, see the <a href="http://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?p=2853161">Annotations plugin</a> that can export highlights and notes to Calibre.</p>

<h3>Merge/Fix annotations on device</h3>
<p>After an e-book files changes on the device, the 'books.db' annotations database may treat it as a new book.
    Examples are re-downloading public library e-books, and changing e-book cover and/or metadata.
    Afterwards, annotations created for the previous file may no longer be shown for the 'new' file.</p>
<p>This tool searches for such duplicated titles, and modifies existing annotations so they point to the (highest) ID representing the 'new' book entry.</p>
<p><strong>PLEASE backup your books.db file(s) first, for example using the 'Backup database(s)' menu option.</strong></p>

Without their work this plugin would not be possible.</p>
