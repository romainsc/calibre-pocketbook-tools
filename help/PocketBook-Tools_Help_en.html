<h1>Calibre PocketBook Tools helpfile</h1>
<p>Basic plugin offering several tools for (recent) Pocketbook readers.</p>
<p>When Calibre recognises an USB connected PocketBook reader, the menu options should become available.</p>

<h2>Requirements</h2>
<p>Plugin was tested with the 'PocketBook Lux 2' driver with Calibre versions 3.48-5.x, under Linux and Windows 10. It should support most recent HD, Lux, Basic and Inkpad models. 
Plugin will also run under 2.58 but could not be tested due to device driver issues (if wanting, checkout CLI options for main.py).
</p>
<p>*Uses Vendor ID = [0xfffe]</p>

<h2>Support and questions</h2>
<p>Please visit the Mobilereads thread.</p>


<h2>Todo</h2>
<ul>
<li>Export highlights: resolve minor sorting issue in 'title and page' mode</li>
<li>Send to device: add GUI file overview</li>
<li>Add additional CLI options</li>
<li>Help wanted:<ul>
<li>test MacOS</li>
<li>testing (older) Pocketbook readers other than Lux 5.</li>
<li>test Calibre 2.58</li>
<li>test explorer-2 backup</li>
</ul></ul>
<hr />
<h2>Tools</h2>
<h3>Copy (...) files to device (GUI + CLI)</h3>
<p>Copies user selected .acsm, .app, .dic/.pbi and font files to the appropiate folder on the connected reader</p>
<p>Note that .zip support uses a simplified extraction method, which loses file metadata (time stamps) and loads extraction files into memory (one at a time).</p>

<h3>Backup Database(s)</h3>
<p>Copies explorer-x.db and books.db(s) to the specified directory.</p> 
<p>The first contains file metadata from the library interface, and reading positions.
The latter contains annotations, together with (unused) file metadata.</p> 

<h3>Export Highlights</h3>
For additional exporting features, see the <a href="http://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?p=2853161">Annotations plugin</a> that can export highlights and notes to Calibre.

<h2>Author(s)</h2>
<p>Highlight export improves upon script idea by retrography from <a href="https://www.mobileread.com/forums/showpost.php?p=3740634&postcount=36">https://www.mobileread.com/forums/showpost.php?p=3740634&postcount=36</a></p>

<p>Building (and improving) upon parts from calibre-annotations and calibre-kobotools by DavidFor and griker, and the Calibre Plugin tutorial by Kovid Goyal.
Without their work this plugin would not be possible.</p>
